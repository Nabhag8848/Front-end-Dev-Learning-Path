<!--You can add images to your website by using the img element, 
    and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.img is self closing element-->
<img src = "Add path or url" alt = "Display this if img not loaded" >

<!--The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and 
    is displayed if the image fails to load. If the image is purely decorative,
     using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
