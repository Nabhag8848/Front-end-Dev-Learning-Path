<!-- You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element
 it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it. -->
 <!-- All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. -->

 <!-- It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, 
 with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. 
 This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element. -->


 <label for = "RADIO">
     <input id = "RADIO" type = "radio" name = "Related-buttons" checked> Twitter
 </label>
 <label for = "RADIO1">
    <input id = "RADIO1" type = "radio" name = "Related-buttons"> Instagram
</label>
<!-- You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute. 
o do this, just add the word checked to the inside of an input element-->
