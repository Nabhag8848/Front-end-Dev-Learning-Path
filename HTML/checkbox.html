<!-- Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. 
By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate 
the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input
 and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match 
 the id attribute of the associated input element. -->

 <label for = "checkboxbt">
     <input id = "checkboxbt" type = "checkbox" name = "Related">Twitter
 </label>
 <label for = "check">
    <input id = "check"type = "checkbox" name = "Related" checked>Linkedin
</label>
