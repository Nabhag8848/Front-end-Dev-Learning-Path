<!-- there are a few elements that give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document. 
At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using.
You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line
For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.
-->
<!-- The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive. -->
<!-- Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line, 
and the closing </html> goes at the end of the page. -->

<!-- You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements. 
Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page 
(what displays for a user) would go into the body tag. -->

<!-- Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Front-end Journey</title>
        <meta />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>   </div>
    </body>
</html>
