<!-- The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>. -->

<div> 
    <img style = "border-radius: 50%;width: 200px;" src = "../img/Nabhag.jpeg" alt = "Nabhag" >
    <h1>Nabhag's Frontend Journey</h1>
    <p>I'm Nabhag Learning Front-end Development.</p>
</div>
