<!-- You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. 
    You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element. -->

<form action = "/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data">
    <input type = "text" placeholder = "Nabhag's Front-end Journey." required>
   
    <!-- Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL 
    you specified with your form's action attribute.-->
    
    <button type = "submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
  if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element -->
