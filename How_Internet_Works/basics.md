## Switch Devices and why we need it?

> - Switch is used to accomplish the communication between two or more computers in same environment.
>
> - In order to connect these computers we generally use a Copper cables and type of this cable is CAT 5
>   or CAT 6 in small environment. ( CAT 6 > CAT 5)(CAT = Catergory.)Fibre optic cables are also used.
>
> - Fibre Optic Cables are faster than Copper cables in Data Transmission.
>
> - Wireless Technology cannot be used in Switch.but can be used in access point devices.
>
> - when we connect switch and computers with cables we created a network. and all these computers are said to be in they are in same network.(LAN)
>
> - LAN: Local Area Network is a computer network which connects computers to communicate with each other in restricted area.
>
> - to Create LAN use Switch.
>
> - when a Any pc wants to send message(Packet/Frame) to other pc.First that packet is send to switch and then switch opens that packet in order to see destination
>   and then sends to destination.
>
> - when one computer can send packet to other they are said to be in same network.

## Router Devices and why we need it?

> - Switch Devices helps to communicate different devices but to enable this devices to connect with internet we need router.
>
> - The main task of router is to enable computers to connect with the Internet.
>
> - In order to connect device with internet, we connect device and switch with cable, switch and router is connected through copper cable and lastly Router is
>   connected with cable provided by Internet service provider.
>
> - when Any pc wants to send message(Packet/Frame) to Internet.First that packet is send to switch then to the router which delivers the packet from LAN
>   to the Internet.
>
> - When any device can send packet to internet that means that device can now communicate with Internet.
